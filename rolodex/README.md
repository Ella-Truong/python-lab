# Rolodex Project
Rolodex is a Python console-based project that helps manage and organize contacts efficiently. It allows users to add, view, search, and modify contacts in a simple and organized way.

## Features
- View all contacts
- Add contacts
- Search contacts by last name and zip
- Modify contacts
- Save contacts into a file.

## Concepts Used
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** - `Contact` class to model each contact
- **File I/O** - reading from and writing to `addresses.txt`
- **Sorting & Searching** - sorting contacts by last name, searching by last name or zipcode
- **Exception Handling** - handling invalid inputs gracefully
- **Command-line Interface (CLI)** - menu-driven user interface.

## File Structure
- rolodex.py: main script containing the program logic and menu
- contact.py: define `Contact` class used to represent a contact
- addresses.txt: stores all contact information in CSV format.

## Notes
- Contacts are automatically sorted by last name
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
