🧩 What is Sudoku?

   Instead of jumping into coding immediately, let's try to think about these questions:
   
   1. How the structure of Sudoku puzzle?
   2. What kind of data or objects come to mind?
   3. What do you imagine the smallest 'unit' of the board being?
   ...


🧱 Object-Oriented Design
 
   Sudoku has a grid of numbers - so let's start small: if you were to represent a single cell, what kind of properties or behaviors do you think that cell needs? Is it just a number? Can it be changed? ...


🔄 Moving up: the Board
   
   Once you have the cell, the next level is the board - made of 81 of those cells. So let's think through this:
 
   1. How would you store these 81 cells?
   2. What responsibilities would you give the board? print/display the board, check if a move is valid, update a cell, check for completion,...


🎮 Game Layer

   Now that we have a board and cells...
   
   1. Where should user interaction live?
   2. If a user wants to input a number, who checks if it's valid - the game class or the board? 
   3. Should one class do everything, or should they communicate with each other cleanly?
   ...


🧠 Solver Logic

   Let's say we want to include a solver feature:
  
   1. Do you think the solver should be part of the board itself, or live in a separate class?
   2. How might it interact with the board - directly modifying it, or asking permission?
   ...
